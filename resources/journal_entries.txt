i see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. as a result of the war, corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed. i feel at this moment more anxiety for the safety of my country than ever before, even in the midst of war. God grant that my suspicions may prove groundless

"as the sequence of day and night, so is the alternation of work and rest, and it is in the minutes of comparative repose that the difference appears between the trained and the untrained student of mind-development. The beginner allows his energy to drain away in idle conversation or mental rambling, in vague revision of past experiences or anxiety of events as yet unborn, or in a thousand other wasteful ways for which, were he spending gold instead of mental energy, he would be hailed as a reckless spend-thrift to be avoided by all prudent men"

filters on subconscious processes such as light therapy, scent selection, room environment emphasis, clothing selection (socks on or off, waistband), which way your are facing / oriented in the room, what is and is not within sight. I suppose this is Feng Shui or something related. this is not the first time the manifestations of my thoughts have led to an already existing theory. For instance, something which I cannot remember (object permanence or some other postulate of perception or assumptions concerning prejudices [in the sense of premature judgements]).

assuming that life has a purpose, that this purpose is static, and that one must follow his or her purpose, and also that you have control over your purpose (may or may not) I select my purpose to be to (1) ease the suffering of my peers (2) ease general suffering of world as a whole (environment, earthly woes and bruises). by fulfilling the former, I ill be fulfilling the ladder and visa versa. this identity of the purposes would initially render the assumption that neither takes priority over the other, yet the former is listed as the predominant obligation due to nothing other than instinct and possibly some sub-conscious reflex pointing towards an absolute truth which I am not ready to see due to it being a projection of my current reality.

"for one thing, disturbance of immediate memory seems to be a common feature of all altered states of consciousness in which attention is focused on the present. It can be noticed in hypnotic and other trances, meditation, mystic ecstasies, 
and highs associated with all drugs. Therefore, to call marijuana the cause of the phenomenon is probably unwise. In addition, the phrase disturbance of immediate memory bristles with negativity. Is it a negative description of a condition that might just as well be looked at positively? I believe so. In fact, the ability to live entirely in the present, without paying attention to the immediate past or future, is precisely the goal of meditation and the exact aim of many religious disciplines. The rationale behind living in the present is stated in ancient Hindu writing and forms a prominent theme of Buddhist and Christian philosophy as well: to the extent that consciousness is diverted into the past and future -- both of which are unreal -- to that extent is it unavailable for use in the real here and now. Consequently, monastic systems of all faiths have used devices like gongs and bells to focus the consciousness of the novice on the immediate reality of the present, and contemporary instructional materials on mental and spiritual development stress the same theme."

love joins together, and one turns the many to one our bodies make us physically separate, yet behind them we meet in love. only when words come from the heart do they have the fragrance of fresh flowers. otherwise they are stale, faded they are artificial,  - plastic flowers. the soil of our minds must be prepared in the same way one prepares the soil for the cultivation of flowers. 

sutra 1 - live in the present, the past is memory and the future is imagination; neither are productive of truth. wake up every morning as a new man, the one who went to bed has been dropped. let the one who is ever-new and ever-fresh awake instead. mechanical thinking of past and future can be destroyed through habitual consciousness. simply remain watchful. 

sutra 2 - live naturally, man’s entire behavior is artificial and formal (the dance) you are simply you, an ordinary human with no name, no status, no class, no family. this is our actual reality. 

sutra 3 - live alone. when she is not outwardly in a crowd, she is inwardly. know yourself in your own individuality. 

boredom - either have no consciousness - then you cannot feel repetition, or have so much consciousness that in each repetition you see something new. never cross the same river twice. either live like a buddha or live like a buffalo, then you will not be bored. remain capable of being surprised. 

5-27-15

perhaps you should find yourself some like-minded friends, stop talking about how bad traffic was and start discussing tactics. or swear to yourself that you will never, ever again do anything but chase your wildest dreams every moment of your life. or buy yourself a liter of gasoline and a bottle. it could be your last purchase ever. 
from the little reading I have done I had observed that the men who were most in my life, who were molding life, who were life itself, ate little, slept little, owned little or nothing. they had no illusions about duty, or the perpetuation of their kith and kin, or the preservation of the State. they were interested in truth and truth alone. they recognized only one kind of activity - creation. nobody could command their services because they had on their own pledged themselves to give all. they gave gratuitously; because that is the only way to give. this way the way of life which appealed to me; it made sound sense. it was life — not the simulacrum which those about me worshipped. 

5-29-15
who, then, would want to be a meaningless fleck near the end of an eight thousand year history of human civilization? conceiving of the world in such a way can only result in feelings of futility and predetermination. we must think of the world differently to escape this trap - we must instead place ourselves and our present-day existence where they rightfully belong, in the center of our universe, and shake off the dead weight of the past. time may well extend before and behind us infinitely, but that is not how we experience the world, and that is not how we must visualize it either, if we want to find any meaning in it. if we dare to throw ourselves in the unknown and unpredictable, to continually seek out situations that force us to be in the present moment, we can break free of the feelings of inevitability and inertia that constrain our lives - and, in those instants, step outside of history. this means, simply, to step into the present, to step into yourself. time is compressed to the moment, space is concentrated to one point, and the unprecedented density of life is exhilarating. you are ripping yourself out of the part-future continuum you had built, hurling yourself into a vacuum where anything can happened and you are forced to remake yourself according to a new design. it is a sensation as terrifying as it is liberating, and nothing false or superfluous can survive it. myth makes no claim to false impartiality or objective truth, it does not purport to offer an exhaustive explanation of the cosmos myth belongs to everyone, as it is made and remade (democratic myths of storytellers = history without time)

… describe metamodernism as a nonstop action, a ‘constant repositioning’ between position and mindsets, something like a pendulum swinging between the above mentioned polarities (diametrically opposed ideas)
enthusiasm - irony
naivety - knowingness
totality - fragmentation


an oscillation rather than stability - ongoing discussion
an argument with no answer

a particular quality of social experience […] historically distinct from other particular qualities, which gives a sense of a generation or of a period

heuristic - enabling a person to discover or learn something for themselves

attempt to chart the ‘cultural dominant’ of a specific stage in the development of the structure of feeling

allows for the presence and coexistence of a range of very different, yet subordinate features

the metamodern structure of feeling can be grasped as a generational attempt to surpass postmodernism and a general response to our present, crisis-ridden movement. the contemporary structure of feeling evokes a continuous oscillation between (i.e. meta) seemingly modern strategies and ostensibly postmodern tactics, as well as a series of practices and sensibilities ultimately beyond (i.e. meta) these worn out categories. each time the metamodern enthusiasm swings towards fanaticism, gravity pulls it back towards irony; the moment its irony sways towards apathy, gravity pulls it back towards enthusiasm. 
sens - sense, reason, direction

“in every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty” - Emerson

ironic and sincere at the same time

i know that the art I’m creating may be silly, even stupid, or that it might have been done before, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t serious. 

convey enthusiasm as well as irony. they play with hope and melancholy, oscillate between knowledge and naivety, empathy and apathy, wholeness and fragmentation, purity and ambiguity… looking for a truth without expecting to find it.

the internet, by comparison, is a strange mix of distance and closeness, detachment and immediacy — our sense of ourselves and strangers’ varying senses of us — that post-modernism doesn’t really seem to describe well. 

metamodernism seeks to collapse distances, especially the distance between things that seem to be opposites, to recreate a sense of wholeness that allows us to transcend our environment and move forward with the aim of creating positive change in our communities and the world. 

a post structuralist theory will always find a way to put things in opposition, like reality and unreality, proletariat and the bourgeoisie, new ideas and old ones. to a postmodernist / poststructuralist either two ideas are in tension with one another or they are one and the same, everything is ‘zero-sum’ — every situation is ‘either or’ and no situation is ‘both and’

one example of this is poets increasingly willing to respond to current events in real time, and to put those responses into the public sphere, even if it means not seeming sufficiently ‘distant’ from their topics to look like the cool, detached, well-trained artists they usually want their peers to think of them as. poets are increasingly writing ‘into their moment’ and doing it ‘in the moment’. the result is poetry that shows that poets are just as confused as everybody else, and just as likely to experience multiple contradictory emotions - and equally powerfully - all at once. metamodern poems will therefore seem both ironic and sincere, cynical and naive, accurate and false. the poet is laying different emotions on top of one another, giving each their full due in each poem. 

metamodern poems also tend to layer ‘realities’ on top of one another, which simply means that the poet might mix her creative writing with material she finds from elsewhere - material that represent’s someone else’s view of the world — or artificially constrain her self-expressive worlds into a form of someone else devised. the metamodern poet is making manifest what its like to be alive in the internet age, metamodernism collapses distance, helps us take stock of the experience of the world.

“this sense of ‘i’ which arises in the boy for the time being, is otherwise called the ego, ignorance, illusion, impurity, or individual self.”

meditation on identity with self:

“this is still a though, but one which is necessary to those minds which are addicted to thinking”

nature of self inquiry: 

“a path that can be followed in city or household no less than in forest or hermitage, with a period of meditation each day and constant remembering with or without the support of outer observation”

“such an experience of identity does not always, or normally, result in Liberation. it comes to a seeker but the inherent tendencies of the ego cloud it over again. thenceforward he has the memory of the True State, but he does not live in it permanently”

discrimination between the seer and the seen

object seen, insentient / seer, sentient
body, a plant, etc. / eye
eye / optic nerve center
optic nerve center / mind
mind / individual self, ego
individual self, ego / pure Consciousness

since the Self, pure Consciousness, cognizes everything, it is the ultimate Seer. all the rest: ego, mind, etc. are merely its objects

the purpose of worshipping the Impersonal Supreme is the incessant remembrance of the truth that you are Brahman, because the meditation ‘I am Brahman’ comprises sacrifice, gifts, penance, ritual, prayer, yoga, and worship. knowledge of self is knowledge of perfection. the only way to overcome obstructions to your meditations is to forbid the mind to dwell on them and to introvert it into the Self. mind controlled, all else is controlled.

you have many purposes; the natural one being to reproduce. the american dream is architected after this 
without reproduction as in a non hetero relationship you enter a different plane. this should theoretically also be true during overpopulation, but the american dream overrides this for many. for those other, and any taking purpose above the biological - do we exclusively enter personal existentialism?

He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor girl with child.

“There will come a time,” I said, “when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this”—I gestured encompassingly—“will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that’s what everyone else does.”

From what has been said you can easily infer that we should adopt the mean between two extremes and must therefore believe that neither are all religions true nor are they all false, but that some religions are true and that Islam is one of them. The characteristic mark of true religions is belief in one God; and this indeed is the reason why Muslims are permitted to eat and live with, and even marry, Jewesses, Christians and others who believe in one God and possess sacred Scriptures.

1 From birth we have been subjected to massive brainwashing telling us that smokers receive immense pleasure and/or a crutch from smoking. Why should we not believe them? Why else would they waste all that money and take such horrendous risks? 2 Because the physical withdrawal from nicotine involves no actual pain but is merely an empty, insecure feeling, inseparable from hunger or normal stress, and because those are the very times that we tend to light up. we tend to regard the feeling as normal. 3 However the main reason that smokers fail to see smoking in its true light, is because it works back to front. It's when you are not smoking that you suffer that empty feeling, but because the process of getting hooked is very subtle and gradual in the early days, we regard that feeling as normal and don't blame it on the previous cigarette. The moment you light up, you get an almost immediate boost or buzz and do actually feel less nervous or more relaxed, and the cigarette gets the credit.

Most smokers go all night without a cigarette. The withdrawal pangs do not even wake them up. Many smokers will actually leave the bedroom before they light that first cigarette; many will have breakfast first; many will wait until they arrive at work. They can suffer ten hours' withdrawal pangs, and it doesn't bother them, but if they went ten hours during the day without a cigarette, they'd be tearing their hair out
